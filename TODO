TODO
====
Implement activity="<something>" to turn the lights to something per-room.
Implement activity="no" to turn the lights off.

Implement symbolic colors:
  * shorter, more readable style rules in scenes
  * allow the underlying color to change with time-of-day, season, etc.
Expose a raw query console in the web interface.

  oh run [all|<daemon-list>]
  oh stop [all|<daemon-list>]
  oh log [all|<daemon-list>]
  oh watch
Show lights in birdseye and make individually editable via an easy interface.
Make a scene editor.
