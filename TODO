TODO
====
Stop logging direct motion events to the console.
Implement oh_motion_filter so we get good motion detector states.
Make oh_home debug logging only go to the log file, not the console.
Implement portals.
Show devices in birdseye.
Make home connections block on the server being ready.
Auto-exit oh_ daemonts when oh_home goes down --
            no point staying up since our state will be out of sync anyway.
Pass port and address to oh_home on command line.
Implement oh_manage:
  oh run [all|<daemon-list>]
  oh stop [all|<daemon-list>]
  oh log [all|<daemon-list>]
  oh watch
Use implicit on/off scenes.
Add nerves back into the network.

DONE
====
Switch apply-scene to work on home only and make it understand room/home activity states.
Remove zmq support from oh_home.
