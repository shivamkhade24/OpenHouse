General notes on working with Huzzah/ESP8266 and the NodeMCU firmware
---

You need esptool to flash a new firmware to the ESP8266. This is only generally required if you
screw up and install something into init.lua that causes a fast reboot cycle.

You need nodemcu-uploader to copy files only the nodemcu. init.lua runs first. It should just wait
a bit and run main.lua to make sure you have time to use the uploader to install a new main if
things go off the rails.

You will need a serial terminal to poke the chip directly. Before installing an init.lua, you can
serial in and manually dofile('main.lua') to test things.

Specific notes for this project
---

In addition to the files here, you will need to create and upload:
  wifi.ssid
  wifi.password

In order to log onto your network. main.lua will communicate switch events via OpenHouse REST
gateway at endpoints configured in each switch.PIN file.

Configuration of new switches is done via installation of new |switch.PIN| files onto the
filesystem of the device. See the existing switch.PIN files for examples.
