General notes on working with Huzzah/ESP8266 and the NodeMCU firmware
---

You need esptool to flash a new firmware to the ESP8266. This is only generally required if you
screw up and install something into init.lua that causes a fast reboot cycle.

The command (for the amica) is::
esptool.py --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART --baud 9600 write_flash 0x00000 nodemcu-dev-8-modules-2016-07-04-00-48-29-float.bin

You need nodemcu-uploader to copy files only the nodemcu. init.lua runs first. It should just wait
a bit and run main.lua to make sure you have time to use the uploader to install a new main if
things go off the rails.

You will need a serial terminal to poke the chip directly. Before installing an init.lua, you can
serial in and manually dofile('main.lua') to test things.

Specific notes for this project
---

In addition to the files here, you will need to create and upload:
  wifi.ssid
  wifi.password

In order to log onto your network. main.lua will communicate switch events via the oh_button
gateway at endpoints configured in each {switch,button}.PIN file.

Configuration of new switches is done via installation of new |switch.PIN| and |button.PIN| files
onto the filesystem of the device. See the existing switch.PIN files for examples.
