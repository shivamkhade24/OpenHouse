OpenHouse
===

OpenHouse is:
* Easy to learn: it is configured with familiar, open technologies. All you need to start is a bit
  of html.
* Entirely locally managed and run -- no broadcasting your every movement across the internet to
  hundreds of servers you don't control.
* Extremely flexible and adaptable -- everything is a communicating daemon, so adding new
  functionality is easy to do without bricking your house.
